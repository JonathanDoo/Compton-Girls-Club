                            of the coding team. An interesting fact about me <br>
                            is that I love doing many activities like playing <br>
                            instruments like guitar, piano, etc and other things <br>
                            like skateboarding, crocheting, art, etc. One thing <br>
                            that I learned from coding was how to build my own <br>
                            website to be able to store anything I want which <br>
                            really helps me store my music notes!<br>

                        <p>My name is Imani Gonzales, I am 16 years old and one <br>
                            thing I love is fashion. I want my name to be in the <br>
                            same sentence as Christian Dior and more. But the main <br>
                            thing I want to do is show the world that black women <br>
                            can also be designers, not just models. Solange's song <br>
                            F.U.B.U, really resonates with me, because I want a <br>
                            black or brown person to wear my clothes with pride <br>
                            knowing that it was made with them in mind. Although <br>
                            I do want to design high fashion, I don’t really care <br>
                            about the money.cI care about the impact I hope to <br>
                            make on the world.
